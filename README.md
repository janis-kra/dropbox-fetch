# dropbox-fetch
Simple Javascript wrapper for the Dropbox HTTP API, using fetch. This is mainly a personal project that is started because dropbox does not provide a Javascript wrapper for their API, and most other projects that I found here on Github that do this are not maintained anymore or otherwise unsuitable for me.
